# Apex Daily Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the daily Apex coding challenges from [LightningChallenges.com](https://lightningchallenges.com). It serves as a space to practice Apex, reinforce key concepts, and track my progress over time.

## Purpose

- Practice writing Apex consistently
- Build a personal reference of Apex patterns and syntax
- Strengthen problem-solving and Salesforce development skills
- Document solutions for future review

## How It's Organized

Each challenge is saved in the `/Daily-Challenges` folder, with filenames that include the date. Solutions typically include:

- Apex classes and methods
- JSON deserialization and API integration examples
- Inline comments explaining logic

## Tools

- Salesforce Developer Org
- IntelliJ IDEA (for editing and version control)
- Git & GitHub

## Notes

This repository is for learning and reference only. These are my personal solutions and may not always reflect best practices. Suggestions and improvements
